# Rust Text Editor
### A text editor made with the ICED Rust library
I am making this app to try and build some GUI skills, along with Rust skills.

## Progress:
- Command + S for saving is currently not working (could be a fault of the library)
- CTRL + S saving **is currently working**
- Added an editor theme selector, as well as the tutorial made syntax highlighting theme selector
- (Yes, now there are *comically* 2 theme selectors, for the ultimate programmer's distraction)

## Highlights
Following the tutorial so far:
- Syntax highlighting
- Tooltip messages
- Theme selection (Syntax Highlight Theme)

are 3 features that are my favorite of the editor so far.

## Extras I Have Implemented
Currently, I have just started working on this text editor further than the tutorial has shown. Some notable features currently include:
- Editor Theme Selector (As opposed to themed syntax highlights)
- More To Come

## Plans
I would like to add some automatic formatting for coding languages, such as auto closing (), {}, "", and better indenting.

Perhaps further, I would also like to implement
