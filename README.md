# Rust Text Editor
### A text editor made with the ICED Rust library
I am making this app to try and build some GUI skills, along with Rust skills.

## Progress:
- Command + S for saving is currently not working (could be a fault of the library)
- CTRL + S saving **is currently working**

## Highlights
Following the tutorial so far:
- Syntax highlighting
- Tooltip messages
- Theme selection
are 3 features that are my favorite of the editor so far.
